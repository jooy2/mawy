# What is not done yet

The repository has no issue tracker in use, and a session that ends takes its
notes with it. This file is where the work that outlived a session lives, so
that "what is left" is a file somebody can read rather than a thing somebody
remembers.

Two rules keep it honest:

- **Nothing goes here that a check already enforces.** The twelve CommonMark
  examples the parser does not answer are in `DEVIATIONS` in
  `packages/react/test/internal/markdown/commonmark.test.ts`, with the reason
  for each, and the suite fails if that list goes stale. This file points at it
  rather than copying it.
- **Confirmed and unconfirmed are marked apart.** A line that says where the
  code is has been read; a line that says "reported" has not been reproduced
  yet, and saying so is the difference between a list and a rumour.

## Confirmed

- **The Flutter preview does not follow the site's own light/dark switch.** The
  React demos take `colorScheme` as a prop and the site drives it; the framed
  gallery is handed `demo` and `locale` in its query string and nothing else, so
  it draws in `MawyColorScheme.system` — the platform's brightness, which is not
  the same answer as the switch above the menu the moment a reader disagrees
  with their OS. Reading it out of the query string would reload a Flutter
  engine on every toggle, which is why it was not done that way; `postMessage`
  into the frame is the shape that would work, and it wants `dart:js_interop` in
  `packages/flutter/example`.

## Deliberate, and not to be quietly fixed

- **CommonMark's remaining twelve**, in `DEVIATIONS`. Nine are decisions with
  their reasons written beside them: the scheme allowlist, the empty
  destination, the size of the character reference table. Of the other three,
  two are tabs — a container that consumes part of one has to expand it into
  spaces that are not in the document, and every offset in this library is an
  offset into the document, which is what the editor's click-to-caret stands on
  — and the third wants a Unicode case folding table.
- **`wysiwyg` in the Flutter package**, and its file open, its own undo history
  and its image paste. The reasons are in `docs/*/guide/editor.md` and in the
  changelog, in both languages.
- **What the viewer's find bar does not search**, in `find.ts` and `find.dart`.
  A match cannot straddle two drawn runs, so `hello` is not found across
  `he**llo**`; a fenced code block is not searched at all. Both are written down
  in the doc comment at the top of each file and on the API page. The first is a
  refusal to report a match nothing can point at, and the second is a refusal to
  cut a mark into every span the highlighter produced.

## Release

`1.0.0` is the current number for both packages, dated in each changelog. The
number is a promise as well as a version: from here the exported API is under
semantic versioning, so a name that goes away or changes shape waits for a major.

The steps are bumping the version in `packages/react/package.json` and
`packages/flutter/pubspec.yaml`, retitling `## Unreleased` with the number and
the date, `npm run size -- --update` if a change moved the bundle — the figures
on the site's getting-started page are those numbers and move with them —
tagging, and `--provenance` for npm, which wants a workflow with an id token.
Publishing is a person with credentials rather than anything here.
